# ARP Poisoning Attack Detector README

## Description
This program uses Scapy, a packet manipulation tool, to detect ARP poisoning attacks on your network. 

ARP poisoning is a technique used in man-in-the-middle attacks where the attacker sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages onto a local network. This program monitors ARP replies and alerts if a device's MAC address changes or if a new device appears, which could indicate an ARP poisoning attack.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Scapy
- Unix-like operating system with `arp` command available

## Setup
Ensure you have Python 3 and Scapy installed on your system. Scapy can be installed using pip:
done by -- pip install scapy

## Usage
Run the script with root privileges to enable packet sniffing capabilities. You can specify a network interface using the `-i` option. If no interface is specified, the program sniffs on all available interfaces.

```bash
sudo python3 arp_detector.py
```

To specify an interface (e.g., `eth0`):

```bash
sudo python3 arp_detector.py -i eth0
```

## Example Output
Upon running the program, it first prints the initial ARP table and then starts monitoring ARP packets. Example alerts you might see include:

```
{'192.168.1.1': '00:1f:9d:8e:ad:a1', '192.168.1.105': '34:de:1a:de:54:f2'}
Initial ARP table loaded. Monitoring for ARP poisoning...
WARNING: 192.168.1.105 changed from 34:de:1a:de:54:f2 to 00:11:22:33:44:55
New device detected: 192.168.1.106 with MAC 66:77:88:99:aa:bb
```
Real example screenshot attched in tar 
In the example, the program detects an ARP reply indicating that the MAC address associated with `192.168.1.105` has changed, which could suggest an ARP poisoning attack. It also alerts about a new device `192.168.1.106` appearing on the network.

Actual Example screenshots have been attached as images : 

I tried 2 attempts , 
1) in 1 attempt I tried to 
arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.5(same as machine)(to create blackholing of request (a kind of dos))


2 )in 2 attempt I tried to 
 arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.7 (attacker's machine )

 in both cases the attak has been detected as shown in images
